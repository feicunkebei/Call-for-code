Water quality optimizer —— Call For Code 2023


## What is Water quality optimizer? ##
Water quality optimizer is an intelligent project that solves global water quality problems. The project can predict water quality based on historical data of regional water quality, and propose corresponding water quality optimization plans based on the water quality problems in the region combined with successful cases of similar water quality problem treatment. At the same time, users can seek help from professionals or provide assistance to areas in need through this channel.

### What's the problem?
As of 2023, global water quality has faced a series of severe situations, including the following main issues:
Water pollution: Water pollution is one of the main challenges facing global water quality. Factors such as industrial wastewater, agricultural non-point source pollution, and urban sewage discharge lead to the pollution of water bodies by harmful substances, posing a threat to water ecosystems and human health.
Water depletion: Global water resources face the risk of depletion. Overexploitation of water resources, unreasonable allocation of water resources, and climate change have led to insufficient water supply in some regions, putting pressure on water quality.
Degradation of aquatic ecosystems: The degradation of aquatic ecosystems has a negative impact on water quality. The degradation of lakes, rivers, and wetlands leads to damage to the functioning of water ecosystems, disrupting the self purification capacity of water quality and biodiversity.
Water poverty: There are still many regions around the world that suffer from water poverty, where people lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation facilities. The lack of clean water sources and sanitation facilities not only affects people's health, but also leads to the spread of water related diseases.
Climate change impacts: Climate change has had a significant impact on global water quality. Climate warming leads to an increase in water temperature, eutrophication, and algal blooms. Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts have also had an impact on water quality.
In response to these severe situations, the world needs to strengthen water resource management and protection, implement water pollution control measures, promote sustainable agricultural and industrial development, improve the efficiency of water resource utilization, strengthen international cooperation and resource sharing, to ensure the sustainable development of human beings and ecosystems.

### How can technology help?

Global Water Quality Information Database: This database collects historical data on global water quality, allowing easy access to water quality information from various regions at any time.

Water quality optimization plan: Provide a water quality optimization plan based on successful water quality control cases.

Information platform: The requesting party releases help seeking information, and the assisting party can contact through their contact information

Firstly, obtain the historical water quality data of the area that needs to be queried. Then, use IBM Watson Studio to train water quality data and predict 8 water quality data of the area. Based on the predicted results, determine the water quality and propose water quality recommendations for the predicted water quality issues





## Project Roadmap <a name="Project-Roadmap"></a>

![picture alt](https://github.com/feicunkebei/Call-for-code/blob/main/roadmap.png)

Build a team in May 2023 and discuss relevant competition topics;

Conduct architecture design and software development in June 2023;

Collect relevant water quality data in July 2023 and use IBM Watson to train water quality models and predict water quality data. Provide water quality optimization plans based on water quality issues, and finally display the data in the front-end
